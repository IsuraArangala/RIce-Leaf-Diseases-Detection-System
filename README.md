The Rice Leaf Disease Prediction System employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, trained on a dataset of labeled rice leaf images. Built using TensorFlow, the model distinguishes between healthy leaves and those affected by common diseases. With a user-friendly ReactJS frontend, the system allows users to upload images for real-time classification, providing valuable insights into the health of rice crops. The seamless integration of deep learning and web technology empowers farmers with a rapid and accessible tool for early disease detection in rice plants
